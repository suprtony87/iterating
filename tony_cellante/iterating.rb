# Each & Map Exercise
#
# Below is an array of hashes, stored in a variable called `blog_posts`. Each
# blog post has various attributes stored in the hash (e.g. `:title`, `:body`,
# etc. Our goal is to iterate through all of the blog posts and return all of
# the unqiue tags, and store it in a variable called `tags`.
#
# Continue below the hash for further instructions.

#
# Your goal is to iterate through `blog_posts` using any method that you have
# learned thus far (cough cough, `.each` or `.map`), and store each of the
# post's tags into a new array, aptly named `tags`. This array should only
# contain the unique tags of all the posts in `blog_posts`.
#
# Because each post has it's own array of tags, you're going to end up with an
# array of arrays after you've iterated over each post. You will need to
# convert this two-dimensional array into a flattened array, e.g:
#
# [['history', 'meter'], ['history', 'prison']]
# ...should become...
# ['history', 'meter', 'history', 'prison']
#
# You may google something like the following for a hint on how this is done:
#
# > convert array of arrays into array ruby
#
# Lastly, because you have duplicates inside of your array, and the end goal is
# to have an array of unique tags for all of your blog posts, you may need to
# do little bit more googling. A good search term might be something like this:
#
# > unique elements in an array ruby
#
# You'll want to do all your work below this line. Remember, the goal is to
# store each of the unique tags of all the `blog_posts` inside a variable
# called `tags`.



# There shouldn't be any need to edit anything below this line
