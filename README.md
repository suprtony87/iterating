Fork this repository and run:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/iterating.git

Next, copy the following code into sublime text, and save it as `~/Sites/iterating/your_name_here/iterating.rb`:

# Below is an array of hashes, stored in a variable called `blog_posts`. Each
# blog post has various attributes stored in the hash (e.g. `:title`, `:body`,
# etc. Our goal is to iterate through all of the blog posts and return all of
# the unqiue tags, and store it in a variable called `tags`.
#
# Continue below the hash for further instructions.

# There shouldn't be any need to edit anything above this line
#
# Your goal is to iterate through `blog_posts` using any method that you have
# learned thus far (cough cough, `.each` or `.map`), and store each of the
# post's tags into a new array, aptly named `tags`. This array should only
# contain the unique tags of all the posts in `blog_posts`.
#
# Because each post has it's own array of tags, you're going to end up with an
# array of arrays after you've iterated over each post. You will need to
# convert this two-dimensional array into a flattened array, e.g:
#
# [['history', 'meter'], ['history', 'prison']]
# ...should become...
# ['history', 'meter', 'history', 'prison']
#
# You may google something like the following for a hint on how this is done:
#
# > convert array of arrays into array ruby
#
# Lastly, because you have duplicates inside of your array, and the end goal is
# to have an array of unique tags for all of your blog posts, you may need to
# do little bit more googling. A good search term might be something like this:
#
# > unique elements in an array ruby
#
# You'll want to do all your work below this line. Remember, the goal is to
# store each of the unique tags of all the `blog_posts` inside a variable
# called `tags`.



# There shouldn't be any need to edit anything below this line

if tags != ['art', 'education', 'science', 'discovery', 'dialogues', 'history', 'meter', 'storytelling', 'morality', 'prison']
  puts "Hmm, it looks like you don't have all of the unique tags stored in a variable called `tags`. \n I was looking for this:"
  puts '["art", "education", "science", "discovery", "dialogues", "history", "meter", "storytelling", "morality", "prison"]'
  puts 'But your tags array looks like this:'
  puts "#{tags}"
else
  puts "Congratulations! Your tags array contains all of the unique tags from the blogpost above"
end

Follow the instructions in the comments, and when you are finished, save the file, commit the code to Git and push it to GitHub:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/iterating/
git add your_name_here/iterating.rb
git commit -m "Adding iteration exercise"
git push origin master
